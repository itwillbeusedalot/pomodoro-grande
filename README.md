# **Pomodoro Grande**: Advanced Pomodoro Timer!

I explored several Pomodoro extensions on the Chrome Web Store but found some inconveniences in all of them. I also went through user reviews to identify the features people felt were missing in these extensions.

This inspired me to create my own extension, [**Pomodoro Grande**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pomodoro-grande/hmkklgcpkihbecjbohepediganhefdof). It combines the classic Pomodoro Technique with powerful productivity tools to help you stay focused and efficient. Key features include:

### 🎵 Why You'll Love It

- Built-in Background Music – Stay in the zone with focus-friendly sounds.
- Customizable Pomodoro Timer – Set work/break intervals that fit your workflow.

- To-Do List Integration – Organize your tasks without leaving your browser.

### 🚀 Smarter Features for Better Productivity

- Quick break-skip for flexibility.
